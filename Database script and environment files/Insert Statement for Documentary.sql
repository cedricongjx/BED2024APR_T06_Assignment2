'Since the Industrial Revolution—an event that spurred the use of fossil fuels in everything from power plants to transportation—Earth has warmed by 1 degree Celsius, about 2 degrees Fahrenheit. That may sound insignificant, but 2023 was the hottest year on record, and all 10 of the hottest years on record have occurred in the past decade. Global warming and climate change are often used interchangeably as synonyms, but scientists prefer to use “climate change” when describing the complex shifts now affecting our planet’s weather and climate systems. Climate change encompasses not only rising average temperatures but also natural disasters, shifting wildlife habitats, rising seas, and a range of other impacts. All of these changes are emerging as humans continue to add heat-trapping greenhouse gases, like carbon dioxide and methane, to the atmosphere. What causes global warming? When fossil fuel emissions are pumped into the atmosphere, they change the chemistry of our atmosphere, allowing sunlight to reach the Earth but preventing heat from being released into space. This keeps Earth warm, like a greenhouse, and this warming is known as the greenhouse effect. Carbon dioxide is the most commonly found greenhouse gas and about 75 percent of all the climate warming pollution in the atmosphere. This gas is a product of producing and burning oil, gas, and coal. About a quarter of Carbon dioxide also results from land cleared for timber or agriculture. Methane is another common greenhouse gas. Although it makes up only about 16 percent of emissions, it''s roughly 25 times more potent than carbon dioxide and dissipates more quickly. That means methane can cause a large spark in warming, but ending methane pollution can also quickly limit the amount of atmospheric warming. Sources of this gas include agriculture (mostly livestock), leaks from oil and gas production, and waste from landfills. What are the effects of global warming? One of the most concerning impacts of global warming is the effect warmer temperatures will have on Earth''s polar regions and mountain glaciers. The Arctic is warming four times faster than the rest of the planet. This warming reduces critical ice habitat and it disrupts the flow of the jet stream, creating more unpredictable weather patterns around the globe. (Learn more about the jet stream.) A warmer planet doesn''t just raise temperatures. Precipitation is becoming more extreme as the planet heats. For every degree your thermometer rises, the air holds about seven percent more moisture. This increase in moisture in the atmosphere can produce flash floods, more destructive hurricanes, and even paradoxically, stronger snow storms. The world''s leading scientists regularly gather to review the latest research on how the planet is changing. The results of this review is synthesized in regularly published reports known as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports. A recent report outlines how disruptive a global rise in temperature can be: Coral reefs are now a highly endangered ecosystem. When corals face environmental stress, such as high heat, they expel their colorful algae and turn a ghostly white, an effect known as coral bleaching. In this weakened state, they more easily die. Trees are increasingly dying from drought, and this mass mortality is reshaping forest ecosystems. Rising temperatures and changing precipitation patterns are making wildfires more common and more widespread. Research shows they''re even moving into the eastern U.S. where fires have historically been less common. Hurricanes are growing more destructive and dumping more rain, an effect that will result in more damage. Some scientists say we even need to be preparing for Cat 6 storms. (The current ranking system ends at Cat 5.) How can we limit global warming? Limiting the rising in global warming is theoretically achievable, but politically, socially, and economically difficult. Those same sources of greenhouse gas emissions must be limited to reduce warming. For example, oil and gas used to generate electricity or power industrial manufacturing will need to be replaced by net zero emission technology like wind and solar power. Transportation, another major source of emissions, will need to integrate more electric vehicles, public transportation, and innovative urban design, such as safe bike lanes and walkable cities. One global warming solution that was once considered far fetched is now being taken more seriously: geoengineering. This type of technology relies on manipulating the Earth''s atmosphere to physically block the warming rays of the sun or by sucking carbon dioxide straight out of the sky. Restoring nature may also help limit warming. Trees, oceans, wetlands, and other ecosystems help absorb excess carbon—but when they''re lost, so too is their potential to fight climate change. Ultimately, we''ll need to adapt to warming temperatures, building homes to withstand sea level rise for example, or more efficiently cooling homes during heat waves.',

'Technology in healthcare is a relatively new term. Although innovators have talked about using technology and computers in healthcare since the sixties, such practices were too costly at that time. Additionally, advancements in technology weren''t properly tested, making it difficult to implement computers into day-to-day medical operations. Fast forward to today, it''s clear that technology has changed the way we work, and the healthcare sector isn''t an exception.

Not only do technological tools expand the possibilities of medical treatments, but they also improve many operations, saving time and costs for industry experts. For example, implementing machines and using digital tools helped medical institutions track medical records easier while helping patients access treatment data easier. Keep on reading to learn more about how technology impacted the healthcare sector.

Patient Portals Provide More Flexibility

Thanks to the global pandemic, telehealth has become the next great thing, and it appears that it''s here to stay. Once used as a way to restrict the spread of the virus, it''s now an efficient method to access health services. That''s because some patients live in rural areas, while others struggle to find the time to book an appointment.

As a result, patient portals and telemedicine technology are a solution to solving this issue. Patients no longer need to visit physical healthcare centers. Doctors, practice nurses, and other medical practitioners can ensure correct personalized treatment plans all over a single phone call or by using a special internal video-conferencing service. This way, people can avoid unnecessary face-to-face meetings, at the same time, receive the needed treatment guidelines.

Automated and Efficient Internal Processes

Similar to financial institutions, healthcare professionals operate in a strictly regulated environment, which means that they need to maintain a detailed security policy by following countless administrative procedures. This is where technology comes into play. Daily processes now have technology helping with efficient workflow management.

Modern digital healthcare services are known for:

Reduced costs
Better patient outcomes
Cutting-edge online platforms
Automated procedures
Operational efficiency
For instance, patients nowadays fill out digital forms that are automatically forwarded to the appropriate department for review. Additionally, organization-wide procedures and information, along with training material, can be sent online. That means the staff can gain new skills without having to participate in on-site training sessions or traveling a long distance.

Artificial Intelligence and Big Data

Big data, machine learning (ML), and artificial intelligence (AI) are also used in various fields of healthcare, typically applications that are designed for hospitals. Cognitive computer systems enable sample analyses, which are made by investigating repetitive patterns and processes. This is especially useful for radiological diagnosis. In the meantime, AI is used to predict future behaviors and functions, which powers machines to learn and improve the work of humans.

Other use cases of deep learning and artificial intelligence can be used for determining patients'' time of death or automatically prescribing the best-suited medication for ill patients. AI helps monitor the status of any patient, alerting doctors if they are needed to be transferred to palliative care, for example. Of course, let''s not forget surgical robots that can now perform complex surgeries that would typically require hours of work for highly skilled surgeons.

Applications and Increased Mobility

Overall, health-tracking using apps and smart watches has become a global trend for a reason. More patients are turning to their smart devices for advice, prescriptions, and other convenient services regarding their health. Mobile applications provide the benefit of having more control over your health without having to rely on in-person meetings with the doctor.

Like other apps, convenience and immediate access to services play a huge role in the success of healthcare applications. By using an app on your phone, you can securely check information about your health and receive updates in a matter of seconds, 24/7.

Here are some benefits of using healthcare apps:

They are user-friendly and very easy to use.
Apps provide clear information and inform patients about the next steps.
You can communicate with professionals easier.
You''re part of a remote community where you can share your experience.
Despite that, with every technological invention comes the risks of cyberattacks. The healthcare sector safeguards medical apps that hold important patient data by implementing authentication services, similar to iDenfy and its remote ID verification solution. That means if you want to register for a medical clinic''s app, you might need to verify your identity first for security reasons. This way, medical institutions prevent hackers from compromising their networks.

Final Words

Technology has made a huge impact on the healthcare industry. From smoothening out internal processes to enabling surgeries that are performed remotely by robots, it''s crystal clear that technology comes in handy. Patients no longer need to wait in lines, as they can book a medical appointment using an app. Healthcare businesses can communicate with their clients better by providing them with treatment and test results with just a few clicks. It appears it''s just the beginning, as technology will most likely progress, bringing new benefits to the healthcare sector.

'The choice of what you eat is perhaps globally as influential – or more – as your vote in national elections.

It always has been. Think about the history of food.

In the beginning there was selfishness. A hunter-gatherer lifestyle promoted competition over cooperation, in line with the logic of – literally – first come, first served.

The transition from a hunter-gatherer lifestyle to a structured agriculture with management and cultivation of crops and animals had massive political implications.

But the dark side of humans – in the form of competition or even fierce, existential rivalry in the pre-settlement era – was still there. The rise of societal structure gave birth to the concept of political elites, which would normally be formed of those most qualified or most in the position to manage the food surplus. Back then, what we would call today a national treasury, was directly linked to agriculture.

With the rise of political elites, the inevitable happened. Whilst the pre-settlement model was based on the tribal logic of us-against-them, it also curbed any individual ambitions which put the benefit of the group first. The new arrangement, however, allowed for the rise of internal divisions, including inequalities and class systems.

Years later, the erosion and soil depletion around Rome triggered another revolution of a political nature, when the empire was forced to establish trade relations with North Africa, particularly Egypt, in order to meet its fundamental promise of feeding its people.

Since then, the management of crops surplus and trade pacts served for many centuries as a driving force of alliances, wars, political debates, and engines of growth for many parts of Europe and indeed the world.

Fast-forward. Think about the more recent times, the start of the twentieth century and the innovation of ammonia fertiliser – “the bread from air” – by the German chemist, Fritz Haber. His rather innocent set of scientific achievements, designed to answer the problem of food shortages following rapid population growth, sent Europe into some of its darkest moments in history. His ammonia fertiliser is believed to have at the same time fed millions, if not billions, of people, but also to have extended the first world war by at least a year, being effectively used as an explosive and claiming many human lives.

One thing that connects all these examples is that every single decision we make about food, every single step changing the way we produce it, has political – understood as societal – consequences.

When today you choose cheaper, lower quality products over those perhaps a bit more expensive, but produced in a controlled, sustainable environment – it is an essentially political decision. If you go for simplified, standardised, and mechanically-produced goods over those from local sources – it is an equivalent of a political vote for your vision of the future.

As we enter the new age of uncertainty and global challenges, when even Haber’s magic formula increasingly seems to be not enough to meet the demand for the 21st Century with 10 billion people expected by 2050, we may be on the brink of another historic turn. Where do we go from here?

I, for one, believe in the spirit of the famous saying of the former Czechoslovak leader, Vaclav Havel, who hugely influenced the Central European understanding of politics. “The salvation of this human world,” he said, “lies nowhere else than in the human heart, in the human power to reflect, in human meekness and human responsibility.”

Appreciating the progress my country, Poland, has made since the collapse of communism in 1989, effectively joining the most developed countries in the world, I feel morally obliged to support others in meeting their aspirations of a prosperous and peaceful life.

If there is a way forward – to the world of no hunger, limited inequalities, little problems with nutrition – I believe it to be strictly connected to our ability to cooperate with each other in the spirit of solidarity and inclusion. The recently adopted set of UN Sustainable Development Goals – including much welcomed actions connected to food security, food safety, responsible production and consumption – offers the real prospect of a better world, but requires a paradigm shift for the change to take place.

Every single purchase of every single food product needs to be considered a political decision. As consumers, we indeed are co-responsible for making informed choices, even if it takes an extra 30 seconds to use our smartphone and check if the product we are about to buy meets the environmental, quality and social standards for the future world we want to live in.

Climate change, poverty, hunger, rising inequalities. It is all one, interconnected fight we are a part of.

This World Food Day, as business and government leaders across the globe reaffirm their political commitment to fight hunger, make no mistake: you are one of them. You are perhaps the most influential of them all, as you are in a position to reaffirm this pledge every time you go shopping.

Spread the word among your friends, and encourage them to make responsible decisions.

The next time you buy groceries, remember: it’s decision time. What you eat is what you vote for.',
